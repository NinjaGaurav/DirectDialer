# Note 
If you are using Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or above you will receive **Force Close/Stopped working** message when you run the app for the **First Time**. To fix this, **Press Back button/Cancel Button to get to the request permission dialogue box and grant all permissions; the app will work fine now.** See the animated GIF below for better understanding:
