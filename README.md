# DirectDialer
Direct Dialer is an app which is created specifically for smartphones with broken screens and malfunctioned digitizer which enables users to call, send SMS &amp; add contacts easily and in a hassle free manner.  
Download [MessagEase Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exideas.mekb&hl=en) to resize or change position of the Keyboard/Numpad for better productivity. *Highly recommended/ essential depending on your device.*
# Download the APK directly from: [HERE](https://github.com/NinjaGaurav/DirectDialer/raw/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk)
    
# Note 
If you are using Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or above you will receive **Force Close/Stopped working** message when you run the app for the **First Time**. To fix this, **Press Back button/Cancel Button to get to the request permission dialogue box and grant all permissions; the app will work fine now.** See the animated GIF below for better understanding:
