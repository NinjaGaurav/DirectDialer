# DirectDialer
Direct Dialer is an app which is created specifically for smartphones with broken screens and malfunctioned digitizer which enables users to call, send SMS &amp; add contacts easily and in a hassle free manner.
# Download the APK directly from:
    https://github.com/NinjaGaurav/DirectDialer/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
    
# Note 
If you are using Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or above you need to manually open the app info from Android Settings and grant the permissions for the app to run properly else you will receive Force Close/Stopped working messages. This will be fixed when Auto Request Permission on Startup is implemented.
